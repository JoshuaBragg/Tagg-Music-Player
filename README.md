# Tagg-Music-Player

Tagg Music Player is an app that rethinks the traditional playlist method of organizing songs. 

Rather than adding songs to a playlist, you instead attach a Tagg to a song allowing the user to create fast and dynamic play queues on the fly. 

Active Taggs can be changed at any time allowing you to switch the music selection to perfectly fit your mood, location and company. This feature enables the user to generate a queue of songs perfectly tailored to what you want to hear.
